# Task 1: Marks_Prediction_Using_Supervised_Learning
Data Science and Business Analytics -1 (Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours)

__Aim__ :Predict the percentage of students based on no. of study hours using Linear Regression and also predict the score if a student studies for 9.25 hours per day.

### Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn

In this task we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn(sklearn) library for machine learning can be used to implement regressions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.

### Dataset

The given dataset has two Columns, one contains no.of study hours and the other one contains the marks scored by him. The dataset can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
